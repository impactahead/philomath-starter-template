# Philomath Starter Template

Fork this repository to start creating your own book. The rules are simple:

1. Write chapters in markdown
2. Each time you add or remove chapter, update `book.yml` configuration file
3. Each merge or push to `main` will automatically build new file called `book.pdf` and push it to the repo
4. Add repository secret called `TOKEN` that will allow to write your repository
