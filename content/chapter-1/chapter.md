This is the place where you begin **your** writer journey.

## Requirements

To start writing, you will need the following:

* Some free time
* An idea about the first sentence
* Philomath starter template!

## Syntax highlighting

Don't forget you can highlight the code inside the book:

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name = last_name
  end

  def name
    "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
  end
end
```

Not only Ruby!

```javascript
import { Component } from 'react';

class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

Now it's your turn!
