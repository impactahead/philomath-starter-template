# Chapter 1

![writer](./images/writer.png)

This is the place where you begin **your** writer journey.

## Requirements

To start writing, you will need the following:

* Some free time
* An idea about the first sentence
* Github token with minimal permissions to write the content of the repository
* Philomath starter template!

Now, just clone the repository and start writing your own content. Each push to `main` will produce the new version of the book.

## Syntax highlighting

Don't forget you can highlight the code inside the book:

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name = last_name
  end

  def name
    "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
  end
end
```

Not only Ruby!

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet("World")
```

Now it's your turn!
