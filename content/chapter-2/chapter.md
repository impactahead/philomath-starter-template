# Chapter 2

Use `h1` to mark a chapter title and `h2` to mark sub-section that will be also included in the table of contents with the corresponding page number. Of yourse you can also use other header levels but they won't be that important in terms of the table of contents. If you need, you can also quote someone:

> Some famous words
>
> **Author**

Good luck!
